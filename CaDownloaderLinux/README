=== How to use it ===

Simply double-click on the "CA Downloader.sh" file, and it'll download and setup the latest stable CA version for you. It'll automatically close when it's done.

After that, either close/open, or use the "Reload Maps/Mods" option in your lobby client for the new CA to show up.

Enjoy!
